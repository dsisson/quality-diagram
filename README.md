# quality-diagram
The windmill diagram for describing how to define quality based on stakeholder relationship to a software product.


## Description
This diagram has the software product at its center; at the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the diagrams are labels for the four stakeholder groups that drive the definitions of quality. These groups are:
+ the development team or product team
+ the customers
+ the business entity
+ the government and the relevant industry groups or industry governing bodies

These four stakeholders are connected by meaningful axes: the development/product team is connected to the customers, and the business enity is connected to the government/industry.

Examples of stakeholder-specific quality definitions are listed along the axis connecting stakeholder to product.
